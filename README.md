## Bad Business Idea Initiative

**Idea:** 

Create a Bad Business Idea dark themed site filled with lots of silly content. Site will use various string methods, array data, categories, user input and randomly generated content to populate contents.  Site will provide users with Bad Business Ideas for use in multiple environments and getting awesome promotions. Maybe you could start your own Bad Business with one of the ideas! 

**Languages:** 

HTML/CSS/Javascript/JQuery(limited)/PHP

**Intent:** 

Using mostly vanilla JS, create a site that encourages a user to input
Name - ex. FizzleBits McQuarrey
Startup Idea - ex. toxic glue mfg
Starup Tag/Trigger word - ex. Facebook for cats!
Attribute of Startup - ex. Innovation
Javascript will contain a vast array of Bad Business Ideas, ex. Ski Trips with Bears. Using fun string methods and various algorithmic javascript functions along with RegEx, I will key in on user input tags and concept sentences to suggest a somewhat compatible Bad Business Idea. Or at the very least, one that has similar contextual wording. 

**Branches:** 

Master Branch contains fully minified versions of all files as well as optimised compressed jpg images
I realise this can be very difficult to read and clone for your own uses
Please have a glance at the Test branch - this branch contains most Master files AS WELL AS my original Refactored UnMinified HTML/CSS/JS/PHP files
Test branch files are refactored and much easier to read and discern what is happening
I found my server to be somewhat slow on seconds to first byte being served and page load for index.html was over 15 seconds before all the optimisation efforts. Google's page insights site speed test now confirms a page optimisation of 96% on mobile and 99% on desktop. GTMetric.com registers a score of 96% as well with a Yslow of 92%.

**Future expansion:**

- [ ] Move Bad Business Idea arrays/categories etc. to Data Base
- [ ] Learn Data Base language/use (maybe do this first)
- [x] Refactor code for scalability and readability
- [x] Enhance patented neural engine with RegEx objects
- [x] Add a contact page that will support email submission of Bad Business Ideas
- [x] Minify, combine and compress Javascript
- [ ] Implement work flow to push submitted ideas to database if approved
