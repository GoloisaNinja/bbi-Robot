## Bad Business Idea Initiative

**Idea:** 

Create a Bad Business Idea dark themed site filled with lots of silly content. Site will use various string methods, array data, categories, user input and randomly generated content to populate contents.  Site will provide users with Bad Business Ideas for use in multiple environments and getting awesome promotions. Maybe you could start your own Bad Business with one of the ideas! 

**Languages:** 

HTML/CSS/Javascript/JQuery(limited)/PHP

**Intent:** 

Using mostly vanilla JS, create a site that encourages a user to input
Name - ex. jack
Current Business - ex. toxic glue mfg
Years at Current Business - ex. 5yrs I start fires in closets
Impact of Desired Idea - ex. Big marble dropping into milk
Category of Idea - ex. Putting a curse on a fellow employee
Idea tags - ex. voodoo, juju, profits, world domination
Javascript will contain a vast array of Bad Business Ideas, ex. Make Dinosaur Island from dino dna extracted from amber. Using fun string methods and various algorithmic javascript functions, I will key in on user input tags and idea impact (levels) to suggest a somewhat compatible Bad Business Idea. 

**Future expansion:**

- [ ] Move Bad Business Idea arrays/categories etc. to Data Base
- [ ] Learn Data Base language/use (maybe do this first)
- [x] Add a contact page that will support email submission of Bad Business Ideas
- [ ] Implement work flow to push submitted ideas to database if approved
