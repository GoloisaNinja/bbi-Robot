Bad Business Idea Repo

Idea: 
Create a Bad Business Idea dark themed site filled with lots of silly content
Languages: HTML/CSS/Javascript/JQuery(limited)/PHP

Intent: 
Using mostly vanilla JS, create a site that encourages a user to input
Name - ex. jack
Current Business - ex. toxic glue mfg
Years at Current Business - ex. 5yrs I start fires in closets
Impact of Desired Idea - ex. Big marble dropping into milk
Category of Idea - ex. Putting a curse on a fellow employee
Idea tags - ex. voodoo, juju, profits, world domination
Javascript will contain a vast array of Bad Business Ideas, ex. Make Dinosaur Island from dino dna extracted from amber. Using fun string methods and various algorithmic javascript functions, I will key in on user input tags and idea impact (levels) to suggest a somewhat compatible Bad Business Idea. 

Future expansion:
Move Bad Business Idea arrays/categories etc. to Data Base
Learn Data Base language/use (maybe do this first)
Add a contact page that will support email submission of Bad Business Ideas
Impplement work flow to push submitted ideas to database if approved
