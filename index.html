        <p>How many times have you been in a meeting? 100 times?  1000 times?  How many times has someone looked to you for answers? In the ever changing world of business technology and innovation move fast.  Ideas move faster.  But what if you just don't have ideas?  What if you have never been that "idea" person?  Worry not my dim witted friend.  That's where BBI comes in.  Moving at the speed of business, we can provide you with a wealth of ideas that will make you the envy of the office and the darling of the CEO.  When people walk past you, they will want to date you, and to be you, at the same time.  I know.  It sounds weird.  But trust me.  BBI is that powerful. </p>
        <p>Simply select to be amazing and let BBI take you on a journey. Destination awesome town. In just a few simple steps, answering a few simply questions, our customized and proprietary algorithm will give you a world class idea.  One that will rocket you the very edges of what the word greatness even means. I'm talking about you hitting the border of extrodinary at the speed of Kardashian and plowing right on through to Legendary.</p>
        <p>Imagine your boss just throwing money at you.  Better yet.  Imagine you are the boss.  Throwing money at yourself.  Did Darwin give up after he just found a stupid bird that looked weird?  No, that crazy son of a bitch married his cousin and found a freaking galloping turtle!  That dude went for the win.  What about you? Are you a weird bird finder?  Or a cousin marrying magical turtle discovery Samurai?</p>
        <p>It couldn't be more simple.  Just click below and answer our short questionarre.  Our custom algorithm will do all the work.  I'll be honest.  I don't know how it works.  We acquired it from an old man standing at a dark crossroad in the middle of the night. He asked for our souls and we eagerly obliged.  What a dumb old man ammirght?  Psssh.  Souls.  Soul vs. Algorithm, algorithm wins Every.  Freaking.  Time.  And now, boom, we have a magical algorithm that solves all your problems and guarantees your success.  Just answer the questions about what kind of idea you need.  Be honest and answer with whatever comes to your mind first.  Some answers are your own, and some are selected from drop down boxes.  This can be used at any time.  On the road.  In a meeting.  Or for extra bonus stupid money, excuse yourself from the business dinner with your boss, use the restroom and click the app.  Get a world changing idea you can share when you get back to the table!  Your boss will think you are one of those people that gets ideas when you pee.  Bosses love those people.  Your boss will probably just give you his/her job and his/her house that point, realizing he/she can't compete with your depth of awesome. So click below, and start living like Ryan Reynolds/Blake Lively.</p>
